Titel: Industry Innovation Automotive Series ~ Electrification
1 Introduction
The automotive industry has enjoyed years of sustaining profits and flowerishing markets. Despite periods of economic downturn, the market capitalization of the world's 5 biggest automotive manufacturers has gone up XX percent - outpacing non-automotive companies in the S&P500 by XXX percent.
More recently, increasing pressure arises from pushback due to environmental concerns forcing the automotive industry to adapt to more strict regulations and exhaust emission constraints. Thus, a Commerzbank analysis shows increasing innovation expenditures and thereby decreasing margins for OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) as well as for upstream suppliers.
A second reason for innovative pressure has undisputably emerged from new technologies aimed at replacing the high-emission combustion engine.
In that sense, the Battery Electric Vehicle ("BEV") has caused the incumbent manufacturers like BMW, Daimler, Toyota and Volkswagen to invest emense resources into researching what had been once been regarded as a nonsense project when Tesla first announced its fully electric luxury sedan Model S.
However, the challenges which had first caused traditional OEMs to dismiss the idea of a BEV have been overcome to a large degree by Tesla and others.

2 Status quo
According to an article of McKinsey's Automotive and Assembly Practice from late July 2020, Electric Vehicle ("EV") worldwide sales increased by 65 percent between 2017 and 2018. However, the increase significantly slowed down in 2019, when the overall EV sales grew by a mere 9 percent. Partly, the authors attenuate these findings by relating to a 5 percent decline in the overall light-vehicle market as well as pointing out reduced or eliminated subsidies in China. 
Interestingly, EV market growth rates varied largely between China, Europe and the United States. While China's EV growth has slowed down to 3 percent from 2018 to 2019, growth in the USA even declined from an astonishing 80 percent to a negative growth of -12 percent. All this, while the growth in Europe rose from 34 (2017-2018) to 44 percent (2018-2019), making Europe the second largest EV market in the world with 590,000 units sold (compared to 1.2 million units in China and 320,000 units in the USA).
Notably, even despite COVID-19, EV market penetration rose by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and is now at 2.8 percent. 
The following more detailed industry insights are drawn from three major sources, namely, the McKinsey EVI insights, the AlixPartners Disruption Insights and the McKinsey 'The road ahead for e-mobility' article. (links einfuegen) 

2.1 Hybrid-electric vehicles
Hybrid-electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles are forecasted to rise in sales volume over the next 5-10 years though growing underproportionately to BEVs. Furthermore, Ruth Heuss (McKinsey senior partner, Berlin) forecasts that the number of available hybrid-electric derivates will remain less than half of the number of available BEH derivates. She grounds this prediction in the fact that global HEV sales made less than 33% of the total EV sales in 2019. These findings are supported by multiple major industry insights like the aforementioned McKinsey article, AlixPartners Disruption Insights and market research reports like this one (links einfuegen). 

2.2 Battery-electric vehicles
According to AlixPartners's Disruption Insights 2020 on the automotive industry, sales of battery-electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles have increased by 85 percent from 2017 - 2019 which fits the data shown in the previously mentioned McKinsey article. Predictions of AlixPartners indicate an increase in both plug-in hybrid electric vehicle sales as well as in battery-electric vehicle sales leading to a combined global sales share of 13 percent in 2025. 
This would mean an increase in sales by more than fourfold compared to a combined 3 percent market penetration in 2019.
Therefore, it seems quite understandable that virtually every automaker has announced to invest in electrification adding up to a total investment of 295 billion dollars for the years from 2019 to 2023. 
However, in order for these investments to eventually break even, the market needs to adopt to the new technologies in ways that lead to increased sales. 
According to a recent McKinsey consumer survey, the bottleneck of EV success predominantly seems to be the consumer, not the technology. As outlined in the report, even currently accessible EV technology is able to satisfy day-to-day consumer needs in terms of range and charging speed. Still, relatively low purchase rates of EVs indicate major concerns which yet seem to be unresolved.
Namely, the McKinsey survey identifies 5 major consumer concerns: Battery and charging, driving range, high costs, car experience and vehicle availability and sales.
Interestingly, battery and charging and driving range combined account for more than 50% of the perceived concerns even though the technology is already capable of satisfying the day-to-day consumer demand. 
So what could be the possible explanation for consumers having major concerns about technological impediments for which there is no reason to be concerned about?
The recent McKinsey article offers 5 focus points for the industry to boost the EV sales funnel experience and alleviate possible concerns. First, McKinsey suggests to offer an omnichannel online presence with tailored purchase advisory. Second, an ideal in-store experience is described as being educational by providing technological know-how as well as hands-on by displaying the offered EV derivate range as comprehensive as possible. Third, the McKinsey survey shows vast differences between probed regions when it comes to the offering of test drives. European car dealerships can potentially benefit from stepping up their offering of test drives, thereby persuading consumers with an extraordinary driving experience. Fourth, dealerships could additionally benefit from test drives by implementing a seemless charging experience both at a public and a private location. Last but not least, McKinsey suggests dealers to provide a state-of-the-art service experience in order to lock the consumer on the new technology showcasing remote maintenance techniques which are enabled through the online integration of EVs. A more detailed outline of the 5 focus points can be found in the linked McKinsey article (link einfuegen).
One more important insight from both the AlixPartners and the McKinsey study is the divergence of consumer needs between regions. While consumers in China to a large degree demand A and B segment vehicles, consumers in the US demand D/E/F segment cars. One possible explanation could be the need for high-range EVs and fast charging speed of US customers which D/E/F segment cars seem to satisfy more convincingly than A/B segment cars.
With these insights in mind, the next section aims at portraying future alleys of technological progress alligned with further alleviating consumer concerns and therefore contributing to EV mainstream adoption.



3 Automotive Electrification ~ 20 - 25 year outlook
3.1 Challenges and potential solutions
3.1.1 Costs
Influenced by:
-> subsidies
-> battery costs
-> other costs?


Electric vehicle costs are dependent on several factors. Obviously, the price of core components like the battery technology severely contributes to the total vehicle price. However, government subsidies, tax exemptions and licensing incentives impose critical sales drivers in many countries as part of electrification transformation plans. Studies (link einfuegen) have found government subsidies to influence customers' purchase decisions by offering a monetary incentive to the customer and additionally a marketing value to the manufacturer. Having introduced subsidy plans more than a decade ago, multiple countries have aimed at phasing out of the plans by the end of 2020. However, COVID-19 has led countries to overthink their timeline  and leave subsidy plans intact. 
China, even though delaying the phasing out of subsidies by another 2 years to the end of 2022, has announced to reduce all subsidies by 10 percent in 2020. Similary, the regulations for eligibility of the subsidies got more strict, now being exclusively accessible to vehicles which have been produced locally.
Germany, in contrast, has announced to even increase direct monetary subsidies after the beginning of June 2020 to 9.000 Euros for vehicles priced up to 40.000 Euros and 7.500 Euros for vehicles priced up to 65.000 Euros.
Besides the monetary subsidies, there are non-monetary incetives as well. A lot of countries offer value to electric vehicle owners in the form of separate parking spaces, special driving lane access and road toll fee waivers (Studie zitieren).

Reasoning structure for 2.2:
1) Growth of BEVs and PHEVs
2) Heavy investments
3) For investments to break even, market share of EVs needs to rise
4) For market share to rise, consumers need to opt-in on trend
5) Consumer surveys from Alix and McKinsey point out following major consumer concerns
6) Market needs vary largely between regions, short explanation of D/E segment focus of US costumers vs. A/B segment focus of chinese costumers


Subsidies in Germany (04.06.2020 - 31.12.2021):
-> vehicles priced up to 40k receive up to 9k
-> vehicles priced up to 65k receive up to 7,5k

Subsidies in China:
-> subsidies were planned to be canceled after 2020 but remain intact until end of 2022 due to COVID-19
-> still, subsidies are cut by 10 percent this year, 20 percent 2021 and 30 percent 2022
-> current rate for > 400 km range remain uneffected at 25k yuan
-> subsidies only for locally produced vehicles with list price under 300k yuan with some exceptions

Subsidies in the US:
-> federal tax credit from 2.5k to 7.5k for any car manufacturer that has not already sold more than 200k units of PEVs
-> Tesla and GM already phased out of the subsidies
-> Some states have their own regulations like California providing subsidies
